## Lens

Lens is a project that aims to securely open up access to data within an organisation. It achieves this through the following:

- Database information is locked behind Google authentication.
- A user is able to easily select from a list of databases to interact with.
- You can craft queries using a GUI as opposed to needing to directly learn SQL.
- Data is presented in a searchable and interactive format, with exportation options.
- For more curious users, the actual SQL being executed is visible.
